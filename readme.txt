Run each task by doing
`python src/main.py`
and then passing the following arguments (0 or more) to run each task:
`python src/main.py 1 2T 2L 2B 3 4`
where 1 is task 1, 2T is 2 with retraining saving data to stats_task2.npy, 2L is to display results from stats_task2.npy
 and 2B is to display the best model from task 2, 3 is for task 3 and 4 is for task 4.
